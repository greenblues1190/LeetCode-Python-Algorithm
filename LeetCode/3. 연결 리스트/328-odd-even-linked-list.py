# https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/

# Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

# The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

# Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

# Solve it in O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return None

        odd = head
        evenRoot = even = head.next

        while even and even.next:
            odd.next, even.next = odd.next.next, even.next.next
            odd, even = odd.next, even.next

        odd.next = evenRoot

        return head
